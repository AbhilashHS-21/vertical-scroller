This is a vertical slider made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

index.html is the main file that contains the HTML markup for the slider. It includes the slider container, the left slide, the right slide, and the action buttons.

script.js is the JavaScript file that contains the logic for the slider. It fetches the image data from a JSON file, creates the detail slides and image slides, and adds event listeners to the action buttons.
